The life cycle of the silkworm is presented in a circular diagram. It starts with a moth laying its eggs on the surface of a mulberry leaf. After ten days, the silkworm larvae hatch from the eggs and start feeding on the very same leaf. During this process the larvae create cocoons made from silk thread. This takes 4-6 weeks. In the next stage, which only lasts for 3-6 days, the larvae fully enclose themselves inside the cocoon. Within 16 days of being fully enclosed, they develop wings, legs and a new body and are transformed into moths. The moths then go on to lay eggs on a new mulberry leaf and the cycle continues. 
The production of silk cloth by humans, as shown in the second graph, starts at the stage when the larvae are fully enclosed in their cocoons. The cocoons are boiled into water to soften. This makes the next step, which is unwinding the cocoons, much easier. Each cocoon yields a strand 300-900m long. Strands are then twisted together to form stronger threads. The threads can then be dyed individually and then be weaved, or be weaved together and be dyed consequently.
