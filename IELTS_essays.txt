**102B - Writing Task 2**

Global warming has recently changed from an extrapolation based on statistics and environmental models to a harsh reality that many people around the world are already experiencing. Humanity's inexhaustible thirst for energy has led to a substantial increase in pollution. At the same time, modern societies are beginning to realize that oil and gas reserves are not endless. All the above phenomena have sparked a new era of intensive research on alternative energy sources. Nevertheless, many state that trying to replace oil and nuclear power with wind power, solar power, burning waste and water power is futile, as the impact on the environment would be the same in either case. I strongly disagree with this statement. 

First of all, the difference in the environmental footprint of a wind farm or a solar park and a coal mining facility or oil refinery is so vast, that it is visible to the naked eye from a great distance. Numerous wind farms are situated on top of hills or islands. Some are floating in lakes or the sea. Whatever the case may be, the surrounding trees, animals and landscape remains largely intact. The same holds true for geothermal pumps, solar panels and water dams. Compare that to a coal mining facility. After a short time of operation of such a facility, the surrounding area resembles more so the surface of the moon, than a natural landscape on earth. Oil refineries and nuclear power plants are no exception to this. Most of the land these facilities take up completely transforms to an industrial monstrosity.

One might say that the visible image of alternative energy sources is deceiving, as their negative impact on the environment cannot be seen but can be measured or be perceived in other ways.  For example, it is often written in newspaper articles, websites and social media that companies deliberately light up forest fires to ease the installation of wind power generators or solar panels within forests. Others state that wind power generators are killing birds or that burning waste pollutes just as much as extracting and refining oil. However, if relying on vision is considered unreliable, then one should at least rely on data. There are numerous scientific papers where the greenhouse gas and overall environmental footprint of different sources of energy is meticulously computed and then related to their power output. Alternative sources of energy consistently outperform conventional sources of energy in that matter. 

In the end, switching to alternative sources of energy will soon change from being a choice to being a necessity. Air, water, waste and solar power will not run out anytime soon. Oil and gas reserve scarcity, on the other hand, is becoming all the more evident. People should focus on making alternative sources of energy more efficient and environmentally friendly, rather than on thinking whether these sources are needed or not. 

**Writing Task 1 - Airport Visitors**

The bar graph illustrates airport usage by travellers for three major airports in New York City: John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark. The chart provides data from 1995 to 2000. From the three airports, LaGuardia consistently attracted the most travellers during this time period, with the exception of 1997 when the John F. Kennedy airport attracted around 5 million more. Notably, the number of passengers that flew from the LaGuardia airport nearly doubled in the said timeframe, increasing from around 35 million travellers in 1995 to just under 70 million in 2000. 
The largest proportional difference, however, was at the Newark airport where the number of travellers hosted grew from 15 million in 1995 to approximately 42 million in 1998. That means that the attendance almost tripled. Nevertheless, the number of passengers remained almost the same from 1998 to 2000. 
Finally, the number of airport visitors at the John F. Kennedy airport followed a wavy pattern during this 5 year period. The chart shows a significant increase from 1995 to 1997, followed by an equally important decrease until 1999 and an increase again in 2000. The airport's peak attendance in 1997 is impressive, as it is higher than both other airports for this year.
