**103A - Writing Task 1**

The table describes how different age groups in New Zealand spend their free time in the span of a year. Watching TV and videos is by far the most prevalent activity amongst all age groups. From teens to elderly people, all new Zealanders seem to spend most of their leisure time in front of a screen. This activity seems to be particularly prominent among people under the age of 20 and people over the age of 70, who spend more than 1000 hours watching TV or videos yearly. Cinema is no exception to this rule, with middle aged New Zealanders spending around half the time in front of the big screen in comparison to the youngest and oldest age groups. One could assume that this is due to the amount of free time that these two age groups enjoy, but also due to the limited social life at those life stages. 

However, the table illustrates that teens and people in their 20s spend more of their leisure time socialising with 4 or more people than any other age group. That time amounts to over 300 hours per year. New Zealanders that are over the age of 70 might not be very keen on socializing in large groups, as they only spend 25 hours per year on that activity, but they do seem to enjoy a social life, spending 200 hours on socialising with 4 or less people. This is more than the young population of New Zealand. Finally, group excercise is -as it seems- an activity reserved for the young, as the hours spent on group sports decline dramatically as the age increases. Individual excercise, on the other hand, is popular among all age groups, with New Zealanders in their 30s and 40s showing the strongest preferrence.
